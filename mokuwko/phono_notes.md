## Sound Changes

### Vowels and "Vowels"

|             | i  | iː | u  | uː | ə | əː | a | aː | ŋ̩    |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|---|----|---|----|------|
| Unmarked    | i  | iː | u  | uː | ə | əː | a | aː | ŋ̩\*  |
| Palatalized | iː | je | ʉ  | ɥʉ | ɪ | eə̆ | ɛ | ɛː | ɲ̩\*  |
| Labialized  | ʉ  | ɥʉ | uː | wo | ʊ | oə̆ | ɔ | ɔː | ŋ̩ʷ\* |

\*varies depending on context

### Consonants

|             | m  | p  | ɓ̰ | n  | t  | ɗ̰  | ɲ  | t͡ʃ  | ŋ  | k  | w | l  | j |
|-------------|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|---|----|---|
| Unmarked    | m  | p  | ɓ̰ | n  | t  | ɗ̰  | ɲ  | t͡ʃ  | ŋ  | k  | w | l  | j |
| Palatalized | m  | p  | ɓ̰ | nʲ | tʲ | ɗ̰ʲ | ɲ  | t͡ʃ  | ɲ  | kʲ | ɥ | ʎ  | j |
| Labialized  | nʷ | tʷ | ɓ̰ | n  | t  | ɗ̰  | ɲʷ | t͡ʃʷ | ŋʷ | kʷ | w | lʷ | ɥ |

### Non-Prosodic changes

- Alveolar occlusives are deleted when they occur between two \[+consonantal\] segmants.

- Coronal consonants assimilate in laminarity to a following coronal consonant. Sibilant affricates become alveolar.
  - n t ɗ̰ nʲ tʲ ɗ̰ʲ → n̻ t̻ ɗ̰̻ ɲ c ʄ̰ / \_ \[+distributed\]
  - ɲ t͡ʃ ɲʷ t͡ʃʷ → nʲ t͡sʲ nʷ t͡sʷ / \_ \[-distributed\]

- Back vowels \[u uː\] become central \[ʉ ʉː\] before a palatal semivowel \[j ɥ\]

- Non-lateral palatalized approximants (\[ɥ\] as an allophone of /w/) are de-palatalized (i.e., → \[w\]) before a velar occlusive.

- Central vowels \[ʉ ə əː eə̆ oə̆ a aː\] become fronted \[yʷ ɛ ɛː eː oɪ̆ æ æː\] after a palatal semivowel \[j ɥ\] BUT this only occurs when the semivowel is underlyingly a semivowel and not the result of vowel breakage.  
  > e.g., /jiᵒ/ → \[ɥyʷ\] but /iːᵒ/ → \[ɥʉ\]

- \[j\] becomes labiovelar \[w\] before \[u uː\]

- /ŋ̩/ surfaces differently depending on what follows it:
  - at the end of a word, its values are as seen in the vowel chart
  - preceding a nasal, that nasal becomes phonetically syllabic (in addition to serving as the onset of the following syllable, if that was the case)
  - preceding a stop, it assimilates in POA (and creaky-voiced-ness) to the stop. It remains labialized in labial prosody and palatal(ized) in palatal prosody.

- \[+consonantal\] phones assimilate in voicing with a following \[-consonantal\] phone. Before voiceless phones, voiced implosives become voiced nasals instead.

- In labialized sentences, non-labialized alveolar consonants cause breakage in following labial vowels
  > ʉ ɥʉ uː wo ʊ oə̆ ɔ ɔː → ɨ jʉ ɰu ɰo ə ə: ɐ ɐɔ / \[+anterior\] \_

## Syllable Structure

CV(C)+T

## Tone

Tone system with several different word-level tone contours realized as different register tones across a word. These tone contours can be modelled as a series of phonemic upsteps "resetting" the natural syllabic tone-terracing of a phonetic word. The upstep can only be assigned to a phonemically long vowel.

Elaborate later.

## Orthography

### Basic Shorthand Ortho for Me

#### Vowels & "Vowels"

| i | iː | u | uː | ə | əː | a | aː | ŋ̩ |
|---|----|---|----|---|----|---|----|---|
| i | i: | u | u: | ə | ə: | a | a: | N |

#### Consonants

| m | p | ɓ̰ | n | t | ɗ̰ | ɲ | t͡ʃ | ŋ  | k | w | l | j |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|---|---|---|---|
| m | p | b | n | t | d | ñ | c  | ng | k | w | l | j |

Prosodies indicated by a preceding w or y at the beginning of a word.

### More Complicated/Detailed Ortho

#### Vowels

| i | iː | je | ʉ  | ɥʉ | u | uː | wo | ə   | əː | ɪ   | eə̆ | ʊ   | oə̆ | ɛ | ɛː | ɔ | ɔː | a | aː |
|---|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|----|---|----|---|----|---|----|
| i | î  | ie | ue | iu | u | û  | uo | e/ë | ê  | i/ï | ea | u/ü | oa | e | ê  | o | ô  | a | â  |

Lax vowels are only indicated by diaresis when the surrounding consonants do not make it obvious which forms they are. Tone upstep on a syllable is indicated by changing the diacritic to an acute.

The nasal "vowel" is written with a capital (or smallcaps when available) N regardless of realization, as in the basic shorthand.

#### Consonants

| m | p | ɓ̰ | n | t | ɗ̰ | ɲ | t͡ʃ | ŋ  | k | w | l |  j  |  nʲ  |  nʷ  |  tʲ  |  tʷ  |  ɗ̰ʲ  |  ɲʷ  | t͡ʃʷ  |  kʲ  |  kʷ  |  ʎ   |  lʷ  |  ɥ  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|---|---|---|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|

A digraph or diacritic-ed form from the unmarked is only used if it would be ambiguous without it. Digraphs are preferred to diacritics.
