\chapter{Background \& Motivation}

The languages documented herein are constructed languages (aka `conlangs') developed solely for the purposes of my own artistic fulfullment. This type of conlang is generally called an `artlang' within conlanging circles. These conlangs belong to a constructed universe (aka `conworld') of my own making. Much like famous author and conlanger J.R.R. Tolkien, I developed a conworld primarily as a place to ground my conlangs and place their fictional `speakers,' rather than primarily building a conworld and creating conlangs for the secondary purpose of `fleshing it out.' For me, conlanging itself is a joy and the artistic endeavor I truly wish to dedicate my time to. Unlike Tolkien, I have not fleshed my conworld out with much detail as of yet. I hope to add more details about this conworld here in the future. For now, I assert to the reader that the languages documented within this book are entirely fictional and that my goals in creating them have been entirely for my own enjoyment and artistic fulfillment.
